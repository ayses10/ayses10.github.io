        Neourosurgery
    </h1>
    <p>I'm learning to make a Website. Neuroradiology methods are used in modern neurosurgery diagnosis and treatment.
        <!--remember to close links with /a--> They include computer assisted imaging computed tomography (CT), magnetic
        resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and stereotactic
        radiosurgery. Some neurosurgery procedures involve the use of intra-operative MRI and functional MRI.

    <h2>Education and context</h2>
    <p>In different countries, there are different requirements for an individual to legally practice neurosurgery, and
        there are varying methods through which they must be educated. In most countries, neurosurgeon training requires
        a minimum period of seven years after graduating from medical school.</p>
    <h2>
        United States
    </h2>
    <p>
        In the United States, a neurosurgeon must generally complete four years of undergraduate education, four years
        of medical school, and seven years of residency (PGY-1-7).[3] Most, but not all, residency programs have some
        component of basic science or clinical research. Neurosurgeons may pursue additional training in the form of a
        fellowship, after residency or in some cases as a senior resident in the form of an enfolded fellowship. These
        fellowships include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatric_neurosurgery" title="_blank"> pediatric
            neurosurgery,</a> trauma/neurocritical care, functional and stereotactic surgery, surgical neuro-oncology,
        radiosurgery, neurovascular surgery, skull-base surgery, peripheral nerve and complex spinal surgery.[4]
        Fellowships typically span one to two years. In the U.S., neurosurgery is considered a highly competitive
        specialty composed of 0.5% of all practicing physicians.

    <H2>HISTORY</H2>
    <p>The Incas appear to have practiced a procedure known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosurgery"
            target="_blank">trepanation</a>
        since the late Stone Age.[8] During the Middle Ages in Al-Andalus from 936 to 1013 AD, Al-Zahrawi performed
        surgical treatments of head injuries, skull fractures, spinal injuries, hydrocephalus, subdural effusions and
        headache.</p>
    <p>There was not much advancement in neurosurgery until late 19th early 20th century, when electrodes were placed on
        the brain and superficial tumors were removed. </p>
    <p>In 1878 Richard Canton discovered that electrical signals transmitted through an animal's brain. In 1950 Dr. Jose
        Delgado invented the first electrode that was implanted in an animal's brain, using it to make it run and change
        direction. In 1972 the cochlear implant, a neurological prosthetic that allowed deaf people to hear was marketed
        for commercial use. In 1998 researcher Philip Kennedy implanted the first Brain Computer Interface (BCI) into a
        human subject</p>
    <p>In 1879 after locating it via neurological signs alone, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848-1924) performed
        the first successful brain tumor removal.[3] On November 25, 1884 after English physician Alexander Hughes
        Bennett (1848-1901) used Macewen's technique to locate it, English surgeon Rickman Godlee (1849-1925) performed
        the first primary brain tumor removal,[4][10] which differs from Macewen's operation in that Bennett operated on
        the exposed brain, whereas Macewen operated outside of the "brain proper" via trepanation.[6] On March 16, 1907
        Austrian surgeon Hermann Schloffer became the first to successfully remove a pituitary tumor.</p>
    <H2>Neuroanesthesia</H2>
    <p>Neuroanesthesia is a field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesiology" title="_blank">anesthesiology</a>a which focuses on neurosurgery. Anesthesia is not used during the
        middle of an "awake" brain surgery. Awake brain surgery is where the patient is conscious for the middle of the
        procedure and sedated for the beginning and end. This procedure is used when the tumor does not have clear
        boundaries and the surgeon wants to know if they are invading on critical regions of the brain which involve
        functions like talking, cognition, vision, and hearing. It will also be conducted for procedures which the
        surgeon is trying to combat epileptic seizures</p>
